    <h2>Added vocabulary exercises</h2>

    <h3>Exercise 1 — Matching and gap-fill (5 minutes)</h3>
    <div class="exercise">
      <p><strong>Matching</strong>: Match A → B (write or say):</p>
      <p class="small"><strong>A</strong>: accountability; implement; feasible; stakeholder; anticipate; constraint; revise; robust</p>
      <p class="small"><strong>B</strong>: 1. limitation or restriction; 2. to put into action; 3. strong across conditions; 4. possible to do; 5. person with an interest; 6. responsibility for outcomes; 7. expect or predict; 8. change to improve.</p>
      <p class="small"><strong>Task</strong>: Say each matched pair aloud, then create a short sentence using the pair (30–40 seconds per word).</p>
    </div>

    <h3>Exercise 2 — Collocation sorting (4 minutes)</h3>
    <div class="exercise">
      <p><strong>Task</strong>: Put the collocations into two groups: ACTIONS and PEOPLE/CONDITIONS.</p>
      <p class="small">Collocations: take accountability; implement a policy; time constraints; consult stakeholders; revise the proposal; robust solution; anticipate problems; senior accountability.</p>
      <p class="small">Speak: For each collocation, make a 10–12 second comment relating it to a real situation (teacher prompts for context if needed).</p>
    </div>

    <h3>Exercise 3 — Sentence transformation (6 minutes)</h3>
    <div class="exercise">
      <p><strong>Task</strong>: Transform the sentences using the target word given in brackets; say the new sentence aloud.</p>
      <ol>
        <li>"We changed the plan because of the budget." (constraint) → "Because of budget constraints, we revised the plan."</li>
        <li>"They made sure someone was responsible." (accountability) → student transforms.</li>
        3. "We will put the new timetable into operation next week." (implement) → student transforms.
      </ol>
      <p class="small">Teacher listens for natural stress and correct word form; correct and model where necessary.</p>
    </div>

    <h3>Exercise 4 — Vocabulary active recall (homework-friendly)</h3>
    <div class="exercise">
      <p><strong>Task</strong>: Choose 4 words and create a 90‑second spoken explanation for each (definition, one collocation, one example from your life). Record and self-evaluate for clarity and correct stress.</p>
    </div>
  </section>

    <h2>Pronunciation practice activities</h2>

    <h3>Activity A — Focused phoneme drills (8 minutes)</h3>
    <div class="exercise">
      <p><strong>Targets</strong>: /ɪ/ vs /iː/; weak forms (to /tə/), and multisyllabic stress patterns.</p>
      <ol>
        <li>Minimal pairs: ship /ʃɪp/ vs sheep /ʃiːp/; implement /ˈɪm.pl

m.pl
ɪ.mənt/ vs implement in quick speech. Teacher models, student repeats in sets of 6, then uses in short phrases.</li>
        <li>Weak form drill: practice function words in short sentences (e.g., "We need to implement it" → "we need tə implement it"); student reduces and times themselves (aim for natural speed without losing clarity).</li>
        <li>Stress tap: for each multisyllabic target word, student taps the table on the stressed syllable then says the word (e.g., ac‑count‑A‑bil‑i‑ty — tap on 'BIL').</li>
      </ol>
    </div>

    <h3>Activity B — Chunking and rhythm practice (5 minutes)</h3>
    <div class="exercise">
      <p><strong>Task</strong>: Take two model sentences from the lesson and practise them in chunks. Example:</p>
      <p class="example">"We need to implement the plan / despite the budget constraints." — Pause at the slash, mark content words, practise stress and then say full sentence in natural rhythm 5 times.</p>
      <p class="small">Teacher models slowed, natural, and fast versions; student mirrors each.</p>
    </div>

    <h3>Activity C — Intonation mapping (5 minutes)</h3>
    <div class="exercise">
      <p><strong>Task</strong>: Use three short question and statement pairs and map intonation (rise/fall). Student reads the statement, then turns it into a question using rising intonation where appropriate.</p>
      <p class="example">Statement: "The revision is feasible." Question: "The revision is feasible?" (rising unless seeking confirmation — teacher explains pragmatic differences).</p>
      <p class="small">Record one example and play back; focus on natural pitch movement and final syllable lengthening for emphasis.</p>
    </div>

    <h3>Activity D — Shadowing (homework / last 5 minutes)</h3>
    <div class="exercise">
      <p><strong>Task</strong>: Teacher reads a 60–90 second passage containing 6 target words at natural pace. Student listens once, then immediately repeats (shadows) while trying to match rhythm, stress, and intonation. Repeat twice more, increasing speed slightly each time.</p>
      <p class="small">If recording tools are available, student records the third attempt and compares to the teacher model focusing on stress patterns and vowel quality.</p>
    </div>

    <p class="tip">Aim for short, frequent practice (5–10 minutes daily). Use recordings to self-monitor and focus on one pronunciation target per practice session.</p>
  </section>

  <section class="card">
    <h2>Controlled practice (Pair/Teacher‑student) — 12 minutes</h2>

    <h3>Activity A: Matching & sentence completion (5 min)</h3>
    <ol>
      <li>Provide mixed definitions and collocations; student matches 8 words to meanings and completes sentence stems aloud (teacher times 3–4 minutes).</li>
      <li>Example stems: "Because of budget , we must  the proposal." Student: "Because of budget constraints, we must revise the proposal."</li>
    </ol>

    <h3>Activity B: Role play — Decision meeting (7 min)</h3>
    <ol>
      <li>Scenario: Student is a project lead presenting a revised plan to a stakeholder (teacher plays stakeholder). Use at least 5 target words and show natural sentence stress when emphasising constraints, feasibility and accountability.</li>
      <li>Prompt for student: "Present the plan changes, explain why the revision is feasible, and outline who has accountability." (3 minutes presentation; 4 minutes Q&A)</li>
    </ol>

    <p class="tip">Encourage the student to use contractions and weak forms in replies (e.g., "we're", "we'll", "we'd") to sound more natural in connected speech.</p>
  </section>

  <section class="card">
    <h2>Feedback & error correction — 6 minutes</h2>
    <ul>
      <li>Briefly note 3 strengths and 2 target corrections (one pronunciation, one vocabulary usage). Use the sandwich method: praise → correction → praise.</li>
      <li>Pronunciation corrections: demonstrate corrected model, ask student to mirror twice, then place the corrected sentence back in the role‑play context.</li>
      <li>Vocabulary correction: give a precise alternative if a wrong word was used (e.g., student said "responsible" but "accountability" needed); practice the corrected phrase twice.</li>
    </ul>

    <p class="tip">Focus on intelligibility and natural rhythm rather than perfect accent. Small, repeatable changes give the best progress within one lesson.</p>
  </section>

  <section class="card">
    <h2>Consolidation & homework</h2>
    <ul>
      <li>Immediate consolidation (in class): student writes 3 short written sentences using 5 of the target words and reads them aloud; teacher corrects stress and word choice.</li>
      <li>Homework (micro‑tasks):
        <ul>
          <li>Record 2 minutes of the student summarising the role play; next lesson compare with today's recording and note improvements.</li>
          <li>Write a short paragraph (80–120 words) describing a challenging decision and include at least 6 of the target words.</li>
          <li>Daily practice: 5 minutes minimal pairs; 5 minutes stress tapping or shadowing one short passage.</li>
        </ul>
      </li>
    </ul>
  </section>

  <section class="card">
    <h2>Teacher script & quick prompts</h2>
    <ul>
      <li>Warm-up prompts: "Tell me about a change you experienced recently. Who took responsibility?"</li>
      <li>Presentation prompts: "How would you paraphrase 'accountability' in one sentence?" "Give me a collocation for 'constraint'."</li>
      <li>Pronunciation prompts: "Listen and repeat: /əˌkaʊn.təˈbɪl.ə.ti/ — now faster, with natural stress." "Which syllable is stressed in 'implement'?"</li>
      <li>Role play prompt card (give to student): "You must convince the stakeholder that the revised plan is feasible despite constraints. Use accountability, implement, revise, and robust."</li>
    </ul>
